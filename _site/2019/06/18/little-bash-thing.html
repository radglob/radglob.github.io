    <p>I never learned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> all that well because I never really needed to. By the
time I was digging into a lot of command-line stuff, projects like
<a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> were fairly popular, so a lot of command-line
stuff was already around for me.</p>

<p>I’ve learned and forgotten bits of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awk</code> here and there. They’re
useful, but often more trouble for me to use and remember than it is to learn on
other tools.</p>

<p>That said, I do try to add little aliases here and there for myself. I’ve been
trying to keep on top of my daily work by logging things. I use a pretty simple
format for my log file names: YYYY-MM-DD.md. I also use tmux heavily.</p>

<p>When I initially wrote my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log</code> alias, it looked like this:</p>
<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">log</span><span class="o">=</span>vim <span class="sb">`</span><span class="nb">date</span> +%Y-m-d<span class="sb">`</span>.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This worked pretty well at first. But I started to notice an issue when running
this alias in a tmux session that was a few days old. The date on the file would
be wrong. It would be set to the date that the tmux session started, not when I
ran the command.</p>

<p>To fix this, I changed the alias to</p>
<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">log</span><span class="o">=</span>vim <span class="si">$(</span><span class="nb">date</span> +%Y-%m-%d<span class="si">)</span>.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don’t really know the difference between the two expansions, but I’ve only
really leaned on them at runtime. This might be obvious to someone who knows how
bash works, but it was interesting to me.</p>

<h3 id="edit-2020-03-04">EDIT: 2020-03-04</h3>
<p>I should have read the man pages for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code>. This is even simpler.</p>
<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">alias </span><span class="nv">log</span><span class="o">=</span>vim <span class="si">$(</span><span class="nb">date</span> <span class="nt">-I</span><span class="si">)</span>.md
</code></pre></div></div>
