I'm not even sure how to preface my thoughts about elections at this point. You
should definitely vote at a minimum. Hopefully this helps your decision making
process in some way.

This is focused on the 2022 Democratic primaries. I'm not going to cover any Republican
candidates for what should be fairly obvious reasons. Also, [given recent developments in
the Libertarian Party](https://reason.com/2022/05/29/mises-caucus-takes-control-of-libertarian-party/), I won't be covering them either.

The slate for this primary is pretty big, particularly in the governors' race. By my
most recent count, there are 10 pairs in the running. I'll be covering lower level
elections as well, but only for the districts I vote in. If that doesn't include you,
I recommend you research your candidates accordingly.

# Elections

## Governor
This is going to be a long read. Hogan is out, and I'm hopeful that a more progressive
governor will get elected and start tackling some of the issues the outgoing
administration was constantly hamstringing (like the Red Line in Baltimore).

### Rushern Baker & Nancy Navarro
**TODO: check out website when not on court wifi**

Rushern Baker is a long time politician in Maryland. He's held seats in numerous roles:
* Maryland House of Delegates, District 22B from 1994-2003
* Prince George's County Executive from 2010-2018 after two failed runs in 2002 and 2006.
* Lost Democratic primary for Governor in 2018 against Ben Jealous (40% to 29%).

During his time in office, he has focused on issues???

His running mate, Nancy Navarro, was the first Latina county council member of Montgomery
County, elected in May 2009. She has held that office since.

### Jon Baron & Natalie Williams
Jon Baron is a nonprofit executive who has never held public office. His running mate,
Natalie Williams, has also never held public office (?) but has worked in numerous
nonprofit and government (?) roles, most recently senior director of communications and
public affairs for the Maryland Business Roundtable for Education.

I should probably back this up with some substantive reasoning, but the idea of
nonprofit executives jumping into government rubs me the wrong way, given the
corrosive careerism of the nonprofit industrial complex.

### Peter Franchot & Monique Anderson-Walker
Peter Franchot is the current Comptroller of Maryland, having held the position since 2007. 
Prior to this role, he was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1987 until his
election as Comptroller. Considering his long public career, he has worked on numerous issues,
most notably education, health care, transportation and the environment.

His running mate, Monique Anderson-Walker, was the Prince George's Councilmember for District
8, up until November 2021, when she resigned from her position to focus on the governor's race.
This was her first and only public position, working previously as a real estate broker for 
Fleur de Lis, LLC, a commercial real estate brokerage in Montgomery County.

One point of criticism towards Anderson-Walker is that her and her husband were found to have
tax leins against their property (which reminds me of the Mosbys; Anderson-Walker's husband is
State Delegate Jay Walker), as well as a undisclosed judgement against her by the county ethics
board. [^1]

### Douglas F. Gansler & Candace Hollingsworth
Douglas F. Gansler is a lawyer who previously served as the State's Attorney for Montgomery County from 1999-2007.
He then won the general election for 45th Attorney General of Maryland, serving in that role from
2007-2015. He then ran for Governor of Maryland in 2014, losing the Democratic Primary to Antonio
Brown, and is now pursuing another run.

His background is a bit of a mixed bag, though my reading of it skews positive. As State's Attorney
of Montgomery County, he made numerous improvements. Under his leadership, his office:

* Was the first in the nation to fully implement community prosecution [^2] [^3].
* Established the first domestic violence dockets, gang unit, internet crime unit and Elder Abuse Task Force in Maryland.
* Issued an opinion supporting the recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages in Maryland [^4] 

As the 45th Attorney General of Maryland, he focused on environmental issues, prosecuting polluters of the Chesapeake Bay,
as well as public safety issues, such as gangs, violent crime, and seedy internet activity [^5].

His time in office was not without controversy. He was the first elected State's Attorney sanctioned by the Maryland Court
of Appeals for public statements made in a case involving the beating death of a jogger [^6].
